# 1. What is Type Script ?
    -> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which adds new features and advantages to JS.
    -> TypeScript can not be executed by Browsers rather it is to be transpiled to native JS then browsers can execute.
    -> Features are compiled to JS workarounds.
# 2. Why TypeScript ?
    -> Consider this example
        ```
        function add(a,b){
                return a + b;
            }
        console.log(add("1","5"))
        ```js
    
    -> Here add funtion takes two parameters and adds both of them but we passed string of numbers this will result in output as `"15"`. 
    -> TS can solve this kind of situations easily by haldling type specefic variables and functions.
