# 1. What is Type Script ?
1. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which adds new features and advantages to JS.
2. TypeScript can not be executed by Browsers rather it is to be transpiled to native JS then browsers can execute.
3. Features are compiled to JS workarounds.
# 2. Why TypeScript ?
1. Consider this example
```
   function add(a,b){
      return a + b;
     }
   console.log(add("1","5"))
```

2. Here add funtion takes two parameters and adds both of them but we passed string of numbers this will result in output as `"15"`. 
3. TS can solve this kind of situations easily by haldling type specefic variables and functions.
